# Pokédex

This project is a single page application displaying information about pokémons using [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/)

When using this application, the user should be able to:

- Type a pokémon name into the search bar
- See the data related to that pokémon
- See an error if the pokémon doesn't exist
- Press 'Previous' and 'Next' to see the previous or next pokémon on the Pokédex ordered by ID number

Technologies used:
- React
- Tailwind
- React testing library

Motivations:
- I love Pokémon! 
- But more seriously: This was a great project to put my React learnings into practice. I also took the opportunity to learn how to use React's testing library to test the application.
- The end goal remains the same: To learn more!
